# Given an array of strings patterns and a string word, return the number of strings in patterns that exist as a substring in word.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

# Example 1:

# Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# - "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
# - "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
# - "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
# - "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
# 3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
# Example 2:

# Input: patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# - "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
# - "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
# - "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
# 2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
# Example 3:

# Input: patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".
