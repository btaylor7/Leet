# You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.

# A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.

# Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "XXX"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: XXX -> OOO
# We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "XXOX"
# Output: 2
# Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
# We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
# Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "OOOO"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.
